# by Timothy Downs, inputbox written for my map editor

# This program needs a little cleaning up
# It ignores the shift key
# And, for reasons of my own, this program converts "-" to "_"

# A program to get user input, allowing backspace etc
# shown in a box in the middle of the screen
# Called by:
# import inputbox
# answer = inputbox.ask(screen, "Your name")
#
# Only near the center of the screen is blitted to

# The only thing I (Mack) did to this library
# was make it syntactically correct for Python 3
# and change some small stuff to make it work better
# for my specific use case.
# All credit goes to Timothy Downs, whoever he may be.
